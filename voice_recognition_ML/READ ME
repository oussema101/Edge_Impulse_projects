PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
"
Project - Sound Classification
Introduction
In this module, we went through the steps of creating a speech recognition (or keyword spotting) system. The same basic steps can be used to create a device that recognizes and classifies other sounds, too!

In this project, we will start with a simple, pre-made dataset, add our own target sound, and build a classifier for those sounds. I encourage you to find sounds made with something other than your voice!
