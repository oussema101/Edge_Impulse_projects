PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

Project - Motion Detection
Introduction
Welcome to the first project of the course! In this project, we will ask you to employ many of the concepts you have learned in the previous modules to create a fully-functioning embedded machine learning system. The process will include collecting data, performing feature extraction, training a model, and deploying that model to an embedded system.

We will classify the motion and vibration data from a machine of your choice. This is to mimic using embedded machine learning in an industrial environment. We want to be able to determine if a machine is off, on, low, high, anomaly, etc.
